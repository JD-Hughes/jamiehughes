2009,June,Michael Jackson Dies,"Michael Jackson, the American pop legend, died of a heart attack in a Los Angeles hospital last night, just weeks before he hoped to resurrect his four-decade long career with a series of sold-out shows in London.

Jackson was taken to the University of California at Los Angeles medical centre last night, and paramedics administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance. He did not regain consciousness and was reported dead about three hours later.",mj.jpg
2010,March,Iceland Eruption,"An Icelandic volcano, dormant for 200 years, has erupted, ripping a 1km-long fissure in a field of ice.

The volcano near Eyjafjallajoekull glacier began to erupt just after midnight, sending lava a hundred metres high.

Icelandic airspace has been closed, flights diverted and roads closed. The eruption was about 120km (75 miles) east of the capital, Reykjavik.

About 500 people were moved from the area, a civil protection officer said.",volcano.jpg
2010,April,Deepwater horizon explosion (BP oil spill),"An overnight explosion in the Gulf of Mexico rocked the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the Louisiana coast, sending spectacular bursts of flame into the sky. The fires were still raging today.

Three workers were critically injured, said the Coast Guard late this afternoon. Eleven others were reported missing after the explosion.

Petty Officer Blakney also said 17 injured crew members had been evacuated by helicopter to area hospitals following the explosion.

Another 98 workers were evacuated aboard the rig's supply vessels and were headed to Port Fourchon, due south of New Orleans.

The rig was under contract to BP PLC.

Officials said today that, so far, environmental impact from the accident seems to be minimal.",bpoil.jpg
2010,August,Chillian Miners Trapped,"The 33 men trapped in a mine 2,300 feet below the surface in northern Chile face a physical, social, psychological and sanitary ordeal as they await a rescue that could take four months.

The miners are sharing a space the size of a small U.S. apartment. They don't have a toilet, and it's damp and hot with little air circulation. They won't see the light of the sun until sometime in November or December.

The men's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube about 3.2 inches (8 centimeters) in diameter, through which food, water, clothing, video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed. It takes 20 minutes for objects to make the trip.

The rescue shelter was stocked with a first aid kit, rubbing alcohol, medicines, deodorant, toothpaste and other necessities.

The men have split into two shifts so half can rest, while the others keep busy doing tasks, exercising or playing card games or dominoes. Stretchers that were stored in the rescue cabin are being used as beds.",miners.jpg
