He did not regain consciousness and was reported dead about three hours later.",

The eruption was about 120km (75 miles) east of the capital, Reykjavik.\n\nAbout 500 people were moved from the area, a civil protection officer said.",

The fires were still raging today.\n\nThree workers were critically injured, said the Coast Guard late this afternoon. Eleven others were reported missing after the explosion.\n\nPetty Officer Blakney also said 17 injured crew members had been evacuated by helicopter to area hospitals following the explosion.\n\nAnother 98 workers were evacuated aboard the rig's supply vessels and were headed to Port Fourchon, due south of New Orleans.\n\nThe rig was under contract to BP PLC.\n\nOfficials said today that, so far, environmental impact from the accident seems to be minimal.",

        "body": "The 33 men trapped in a mine 2,300 feet below the surface in northern Chile face a physical, social, psychological and sanitary ordeal as they await a rescue that could take four months.\n\nThe miners are sharing a space the size of a small U.S. apartment. They don't have a toilet, and it's damp and hot with little air circulation. They won't see the light of the sun until sometime in November or December.\n\nThe men's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube about 3.2 inches (8 centimeters) in diameter, through which food, water, clothing, video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed. It takes 20 minutes for objects to make the trip.\n\nThe rescue shelter was stocked with a first aid kit, rubbing alcohol, medicines, deodorant, toothpaste and other necessities.\n\nThe men have split into two shifts so half can rest, while the others keep busy doing tasks, exercising or playing card games or dominoes. Stretchers that were stored in the rescue cabin are being used as beds.",
